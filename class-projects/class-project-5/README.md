# Next.js - Dynamic routes, data fetching

Implement Dynamic Routes.

 Server-Side Data Fetching:

    -Integrate JSONPlaceholder, a free online REST API, to fetch fake product data dynamically. Alternatively, use your own REST API server.
    -Use server-side data fetching methods to retrieve product information from JSONPlaceholder and populate the blog pages with realistic fake data.
    -Optionally (for more experienced): Try to implement pagination.


Deploy to Vercel or Netlify.
